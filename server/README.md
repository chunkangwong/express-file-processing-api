# File Processing API with Express TS

This is a simple API that allows you to upload a file and then process it. The files uploaded to the API will be processed by:

1. reading the file,
2. converting the file content to uppercase,
3. writing the converted content to a new file, and finally
4. serving the new file to the client as response.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`, you should see the following message:

   ```
   Hello World!
   ```
